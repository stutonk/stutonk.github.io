 NAME
        <a href="https://www.github.com/stutonk/pipecrypt">pipecrypt</a> - encrypt and decrypt streams with a key

 SYNOPSIS
        pipecrypt [-h, -v] key
 
 DESCRIPTION
        pipecrypt is a lightweight alternatve to PGP for securely encrypting
        streams using NaCl's secretbox. It expects a hexidecimal string as an
        argument which should be 64 characters (32 bytes) long -- additional
        characters are ignored. The program reads from STDIN and writes to
        STDOUT.
 
 OPTIONS
        -d, --decrypt
               operate in decrypt mode
 
        -h, --help
               display help and exit
 
        -v --version
               output version information and exit
 
 SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
        This program was primarily designed to be used in scripts; be mindful
        of your shell history when using it in interactive mode. The best
        practice is to use your shell's command substitution functionality to
        read the key from a file or output of some other program.
