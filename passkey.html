 NAME
        <a href="https://www.github.com/stutonk/passkey">passkey</a> - generate a cryptographic key from a passphrase

 SYNOPSIS
        passkey [-h, -v] [-b] [-s salt] [passphrase]
 
 DESCRIPTION
        passkey is a simple utility for generating cryptographic keys from a
        passphrase using the Argon2 algorithm. Passphrases may be any string
        when passed as an argument or any sequence of bytes when read from
        STDIN. The program will automatically generate a fresh 128-byte salt if
        one is not provided as an option. Keys are output as 64 hexadecimal
        characters (32 bytes when using binary output) prepended to the salt
        that was used to generate them.
 
 OPTIONS
        -b, --binary
               output in binary mode
 
        -h, --help
               display help and exit
 
        -s, --salt
               provide salt as a hexidecimal string
 
        -v, --version
               output version information and exit
 
 EXAMPLES
        passkey "some passphrase"
 
        passkey -s 0123456789abcdef spaces in passphrases are okay too
