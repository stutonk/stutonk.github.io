NAME
       <a href="https://www.github.com/stutonk/pen">pen</a> - encrypt and decrypt files with a password

SYNOPSIS
       pen [-h, -v] file [files...]

DESCRIPTION
       Pen is a lightweight alternatve to PGP for securely encrypting files;
       it uses the Argon2 algorithm to generate a key from a passphrase and
       NaCl's secretbox to encrypt the file. If a filename ends in '.pen', it
       will be decrypted rather than encrypted. Upon successful encryption or
       decryption, the original file or .pen file, respectively, is removed.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              display help and exit

       -v --version
              output version information and exit

SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
       Due to the nature of underlying filesystems and their underlying
       hardware, no attempt is made to shred the original file before it is
       removed following encryption. A determined person or law enforcement
       agency with access to your raw disk WILL be able to recover the
       original file. Therefore, it is advised that for critical applications
       you use a more mature solution that follows stricter security
       protocols.
