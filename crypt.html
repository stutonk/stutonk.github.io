                    This is a set of command line tools for securing files and streams
                    with simple passphrases and NaCl's secretbox encryption scheme. They
                    were written so that regular people could avoid having to wade into any
                    of that pgp/openssl nightmare. Each is written in Go, compiles to a
                    binary with no dependencies, and is available for all major plafrorms.

                <p>
                    pen {en,de}crypts files. If the filename ends in `.pen`, then it is decrypted.
                    Otherwise it is encrypted.
                    <pre>
usage: pen [-h, -v] file [files...]
Options are:
    -h, --help      display this help and exit
    -v, --version   output version information and exit
                    </pre>

                <p>
                    pipecrypt reads STDIN and writes the {en,de}crypted result to STDOUT;
                    it was designed to be used with the passkey program.
                    <pre>
usage: ./pipecrypt [-h, -v] key
Reads from STDIN; writes to STDOUT
Options are:
    -d, --decrypt   operate in decrypt mode
    -h, --help      display this help and exit
    -v, --version   output version information and exit
                    </pre>

                <p>
                    passkey generates cryptographic keys from passphrases; it was designed to
                    be used with pipecrypt.
                    <pre>
usage: passkey [-h, -v] [-s salt] [passphrase]
If no passphrase given, read from STDIN
Options are:
    -h, --help          display this help and exit
    -s, --salt string   provide salt as a hexidecimal string
    -v, --version       output version information and exit
